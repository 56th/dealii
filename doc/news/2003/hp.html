  <li> <p>
       Changed:
       Changed <code>FE</code> to
       <code>FECollection</code> at several places and
       also changed depending functions accordingly. Modified the
       <code>reserve_space</code> method of
       <code>hpDoFHandler</code> to work for 2D
       DG-problems. In this context the 2D code for
       <code class"member">pre_refinement_notification</code> was
       added as well.
       <br>
       (Oliver Kayser-Herold 2003/12/11)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Changed: 
       Implemented a couple of small modifications to get a first 1D
       hp-example running. The <code>Triangulation</code>
       class was extended by a method to add
       <code>RefinementListener</code>s, which allow
       other classes to be informed about Refinements. This is
       needed for the <code>hpDoFHandler</code>, which
       administrates the <code>active_fe_indices</code>
       in the <code>hpDoFLevel</code>s. Once this
       was implemented, the other changes were straightforward. For
       1D, the only thing which had to be changed for hp was the
       <code>reserve_space</code> method.
       Last but not least, for the hp-example the
       <code>add</code> method was added to the
       <code>FECollection</code>. It allows the user to
       add new <code>FiniteElements</code>s to the
       the <code>FECollection</code>.
       <br>
       (Oliver Kayser-Herold 2003/06/01)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Changed: Introduced the <code>DoFHandler</code>
       as template parameter in classes <code>DataOutStack</code>,
       <code>DataOutFaces</code>, <code>DataOut</code> and 
       <code>DataOut_DoFData</code>.
       <code>DoFHandler</code> is used as default
       template argument to ensure backward compatibility. Added
       an overloaded method <code>reinit</code> for the
       new <code>hpDoFHandler</code> in class
       <code>FEValues</code>. Modified method
       <code>interpolate_boundary_values</code> in
       class <code>VectorTools</code> to take the
       <code>DoFHandler</code> as template
       argument. Probably this method must be changed later, when the real
       <code>hpDoFHandler</code> is implemented. Added
       the first implementation of the
       <code>hpDoFHandler</code> which is simply a copy
       of the old one. But it should provide a good basis for the new
       one. Finally the <code>DoFAccessor</code> is now
       instantiated for the new
       <code>hpDoFAccessor</code>. Overall these changes
       now allow the compilation of some of the sample programs with
       the new <code>hpDoFAccessor</code> but obviously
       not yet with new functionality.
       <br>
       (Oliver Kayser-Herold 2003/02/18)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Changed: The <code>DoFHandler::n_boundary_dofs</code>
       functions have been moved and renamed. They are now
       <code>DoFTools::count_boundary_dofs</code>.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/02/18)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Changed: The <code>DoFLevel</code> classes has been moved to
       a namespace <code>internal</code>, since they are not
       meant for public use.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/02/18)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Changed: Many of the functions in <code>DoFTools</code>
       are now templatized to accept both <code>DoFHandler</code>
       and <code>hpDoFHandler</code> objects.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/02/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Changed: The <code>TriaDimensionInfo</code> and
       <code>DoFDimensionInfo</code> classes that were used to
       declare typedefs for the iterators have been moved to a namespace
       internal (so as to get them out of the class index in the documentation
       -- these classes were not meant for use in applications after all), and
       have been renamed to <code>TriaIteratorSelector</code>
       and <code>DoFIteratorSelector</code>, since that is what
       they are.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/02/13)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Changed: Due to the demand for different <code
       class="class">DoFHandler</code> classes (mainly for the planned
       hp-DoFHandler) the DoFHandler has been introduced as a
       template parameter into the <code>DoFAccessor</code>,
       the <code>DoFObjectAccessor</code>,
       and the <code>DoFCellAccessor</code> classes.
       Furthermore the <code>DoFHandler</code> was
       also introduced as template parameter into the
       <code>DoFDimensionInfo</code>
       class. These changes induced several little changes in a couple
       of methods to get the code through the compiler. But no
       functionality was affected.
       <br>
       (Oliver Kayser-Herold 2003/01/24)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Changed: There are now overloaded versions of the <code
       class="member">FEValues::reinit</code> function (and likewise in the
       <code>FEFaceValues</code> and <code
       class="class">FESubFaceValues</code> classes) that either take a
       <code>Triangulation::cell_iterator</code> or a
       <code>DoFHandler::cell_iterator</code>. That means that
       you can compute certain data with only the geometrical information the
       former provides, independent of whether degrees of freedom are
       associated with this cell or not. However, certain functions of the
       <code>FEValues</code> class will throw an error if you
       attempt to use them without DoF data being delivered in the
       reinitialization call; these functions need to extract values from
       finite element fields, and are mostly the
       <code
       class="member">FEValues::get_function_values/grads/2nd_derivatives</code>
       functions.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/01/20)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Changed: The <code
       class="member">Mapping::transform_real_to_unit_cell</code> and
       <code>Mapping::transform_unit_to_real_cell</code>
       now only take a <code>Triangulation::cell_iterator</code>
       instead of a <code>DoFHandler::cell_iterator</code> as
       previously. This is also reasonable, since they only need the geometric
       information.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/01/20)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Changed: The <code>FiniteElement::fill_fe_*_values</code>
       now only take a <code>Triangulation::cell_iterator</code>
       instead of a <code>DoFHandler::cell_iterator</code> as
       previously. Likewise for <code
       class="member">FiniteElementBase::compute_2nd</code> and <code
       class="member">FESystem::compute_fill</code>, and the 
       <code>Mapping::fill_fe_*_values</code> functions.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/01/20)
