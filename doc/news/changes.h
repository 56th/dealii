<h3 style="color:red">Incompatibilities</h3>

<p style="color:red">
Following are a few modifications to the library that unfortunately
are incompatible with previous versions of the library, but which we
deem necessary for the future maintainability of the
library. Unfortunately, some of these changes will require
modifications to application programs. We apologize for the
inconvenience this causes.

  <li> Changed: ConstraintMatrix::distribute_local_to_global() and numerous
  functions in VectorTools namespace now require matching data types.
  This is done to correctly handle complex-valued case.
