New: The Manifold class and derived classes now provide a function
Manifold::add_new_points that allows to compute multiple new points according
to a matrix of weights that are appended to the last argument of the
function. This function is used in MappingQGeneric and can be much more
efficient for ChartManifold because ChartManifold::pull_back() calls are
reused for several interpolation operations.
