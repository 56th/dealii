Changed: The parallel triangulation classes parallel::shared::Triangulation
and parallel::distributed::Triangulation used to duplicate the MPI
communicator given to the constructor, which could lead to access-after-free
problems in Trilinos data structures based on this communicator that stayed
alive longer than the Triangulation. The new implementation simply uses the
MPI communicator provided by the user and thus avoids these problems. It is
the user's responsibility to make sure MPI_Comm_free is only called when all
data structures initialized with it are deleted.
