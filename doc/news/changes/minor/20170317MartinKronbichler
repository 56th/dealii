Improved: The mechanism for placing the additional points of a MappingQ or
MappingQGeneric between different Manifolds or between an old-style Boundary
class and the interior StraightBoundary has been reworked. In the new
implementation, a smoothing algorithm is invoked that interpolates from the
whole perimeter of a cell's (or a face's) interior in case two or more
manifolds are adjacent to the cell, like a Boundary object and the
StraightBoundary in the interior. If only one manifold is present, the new
points are interpolated from the surrounding vertices only.
