Improved: The mechanism for placing the additional points of a MappingQ or
MappingQGeneric between different Manifolds or between an old-style Boundary
class and the interior StraightBoundary has been reworked. In the new
implementation, a smoothing algorithm is invoked that interpolates from the
whole perimeter of a cell's (or a face's) interior in case two or more
manifolds are adjacent to the cell, like a Boundary object and the
StraightBoundary in the interior. If only one manifold is present, the new
points are interpolated from the surrounding vertices only. In case the
smoothing is undesired, it can be disabled by an argument
@p smooth_support_points passed to the constructor of MappingQGeneric.
