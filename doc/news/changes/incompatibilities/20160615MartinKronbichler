Changed: The deal.II distributed vector classes do now derive from
LinearAlgebra::VectorSpaceVector and have been moved to the
LinearAlgebra::distributed namespace. In the definition of the new interfaces,
several old vector functions have been marked as deprecated. The methods
<tt>operator==</tt>, <tt>operator!=</tt>, <tt>is_non_negative</tt>, and
<tt>norm_sqr</tt> have been removed from the new interface. For the latter,
there exists a simple workaround as it simply corresponds to the square of
<tt>l2_norm</tt>.
