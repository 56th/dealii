Fixed: The MappingQGeneric class (which is a base class of MappingQ)
sometimes set the update_JxW_values flag internally, even though this
was not necessary. This resulted in doing more work than was actually
necessary, and this has been rectified. On the other hand, this change
means that in some circumstances, codes may not have <i>explicitly</i>
told an FEValues or FEFaceValues object that they actually need the
JxW values, but could access them anyway without getting an
error. This will now yield an error that is easily fixed by
explicitly listing update_JxW_values as a required flag where you
create the FEValues object.
