Changed: PETScWrappers::VectorBase::operator= is now both private and
undefined. This operator was formerly implicitly defined (i.e., it did a
byte-for-byte copy of VectorBase's members), which provided, almost certainly,
the wrong behavior since the underlying <code>Vec</code> (the managed PETSc
object) would then be destroyed twice. Since both inheriting classes
(PETScWrappers::Vector and PETScWrappers::MPI::Vector) define their own
operator= overloads this operator is also not necessary.
